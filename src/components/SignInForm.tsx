/*
 * This is one of the best component I have created so far.
 *
 * This component reads the nextAuth providers after the first render, using useEffect() hook
 * Then each provider will be mapped to form, which will invoke an server action when being submitted
 * The form will pass the name of the provider to the action, and eventaully calls the nextAuth signIn function in server
 * In the meanwhile, as each button gets the status of its form using the useFormStatus hook
 * so if the button is associated with a form that is being submitted, the button turns into loading state
